            <br> <br>
            We would also like to mention here that, this event is inspired by the International Festival of Language & Culture, where in the last 13 years a significant number of the Bangladeshi English Medium school’s students have participated in Albania, Australia, Germany, Mongolia, Morocco, Philippine, Romania, Thailand and Turkey. In addition, these events and participation are being organized and sponsored by International Turkish Hope School since the birth of Bangla Olympiad.<br> <br>

            ITHS always has been expressing profound admiration to the heroic language martyrs who had enabled the World to celebrate the 21st February as the International Mother Language Day since its establishment. As the day is being celebrated enthusiastically in different parts of Bangladesh with various cultural activities, ITHS also organizes such cultural events in order for the students to be mindful of rich Bangla Language and culture. Evidently, this philosophy and awareness programs have been playing a significant role in their upbringing and providing an opportunity to display our heritage in International Festival of Language and Culture platforms.<br> <br>
